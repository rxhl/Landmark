# Landmark
Find great places near you.

A basic Yelp-clone that displays points of interest in a given location. Built using Python, LeafletJS, PostgreSQL, GeoData API and deployed on Heroku. Try it at https://landmarkx.herokuapp.com/

**Note:** Due to a deployment issue with PostgreSQL on Heroku, the site is currently unavailable. You may see a demo [here](https://youtu.be/nLvF-uB40-U). Additionally, you may download the repo and run it locally on your machine.

## Instructions

1. Download and unzip the repo. Then install the following dependencies.
2. ```$ pip install Flask```
3. ```$ pip install SQLAlchemy```
4. ```$ pip install requests```
5. Make sure you have PostgresSQL installed (I'm using v9.6)
6. Open the repo on your local machine and run ```$ python routes.py```
7. Flask will create a local server and the application can be used at localhost:5000 from your browser.
8. Sign Up/Log In and have fun!

Contributions are welcome.
