# Landmark

Find great places near you.

A basic Yelp-clone that displays points of interest in a given location. Built using Python, LeafletJS, PostgreSQL, GeoData API and deployed on Heroku. Try it at https://landmarkx.herokuapp.com/

**Note:** Due to deployment issues with PostgreSQL on Heroku, the site may be unavailable at times. You may see a demo [here](https://youtu.be/nLvF-uB40-U). Additionally, you may download the repo and run it locally on your system.

## Development

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rxhl/Landmark.git && cd Landmark
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python routes.py
```

Flask will create a local server and the application can be used at localhost:5000 from your browser. Sign Up/Log In and and start using!

Contributions are welcome.
